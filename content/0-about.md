The **BayesAI Workshop** is a week-long workshop at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk), between 23rd - 26th September 2024. It is supported by the [STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) and the [Prob_AI Hub](https://www.probai.uk). The themes of the workshop include *Physics-Informed Neural Networks* (PINNs), *Generative Modelling*, and *Monte Carlo for Machine Learning*.   


## Organizers

The **Prob_AI Hub** is a £8.5M research hub funded by EPSRC to develop better understanding of and new methods in AI. This will be achieved by research at the interface of AI and Mathematics. The Prob_AI hub will focus on probabilistic AI, and bring researchers with skills across areas such as Bayesian and Computational Statistics, Dynamical Systems, Numerical Analysis, PDES, Probability, Stochastic Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification to work with AI and Machine Learning researchers.

**STOR-i** was established in 2010 as an EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training. Its academic prowess and high levels of success have led to a further investment from 2019 with an increased capacity of potential students to 70 in total across the full cohort. This is a multi-million pound award from EPSRC, substantial support from Lancaster University and an additional £5.2m from Industrial Partners. All partners see a national need for the cohort-based approach offered by STOR-i and together will expand on its existing success.
