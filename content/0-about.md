The **BayesAI Workshop** is a week-long workshop at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk), between 23rd - 26th September 2024. It is supported by the [STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) and the [Prob_AI Hub](https://www.probai.uk). The themes of the workshop include *Physics-Informed Neural Networks* (PINNs), *Generative Modelling*, and *Monte Carlo for Machine Learning*.   

### Physics-Informed Neural Networks

**Physics-informed neural networks** (PINNs) represent a cutting-edge approach in computational modeling that integrates the principles of physics directly into the structure of neural networks. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely solely on data, PINNs embed physical laws, expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs), into the learning process. This fusion allows PINNs to not only learn from data but also adhere to the fundamental principles governing the physical systems they model, such as conservation laws and boundary conditions. This results in models that are more accurate and generalizable, particularly in scenarios with limited or noisy data. Applications of PINNs span a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines, including fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and climate modeling, demonstrating their potential to solve complex, real-world problems efficiently.

### Generative Modelling

**Generative Modelling** is a rapidly evolving field within artificial intelligence focused on creating models that can generate new content, such as images, text, music, and even videos, that is indistinguishable from human-made creations. At its core are advanced machine learning techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Transformer-based models, which learn patterns and structures from vast datasets. These models have transformative applications across various domains: they can create realistic images from textual descriptions, compose music, write coherent and contextually relevant articles, and even assist in drug discovery by generating novel molecular structures. The field of generative AI not only pushes the boundaries of creativity and automation but also raises important ethical considerations regarding originality, authorship, and the potential for misuse, prompting ongoing discussions about regulation and responsible AI development.

### Monte Carlo for Machine Learning 

**Monte Carlo for machine learning** refer to a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results, often for problems that are deterministic in principle but complex in practice. These methods are particularly powerful for approximating difficult-to-compute functions, evaluating integrals, and optimizing parameters in high-dimensional spaces. In machine learning, Monte Carlo techniques are widely used for tasks such as Bayesian inference, where they help estimate the posterior distributions of model parameters, and in reinforcement learning, where they assist in policy evaluation and optimization. By leveraging randomness and statistical sampling, Monte Carlo methods provide robust and scalable solutions to otherwise intractable problems, enabling the development of more accurate and efficient machine learning models. This approach is crucial in scenarios where exact solutions are impractical due to the sheer complexity or computational expense involved, making Monte Carlo methods a foundational tool in the machine learning toolkit.




## Organizers

The **ProbAI Hub** is a £8.5M research hub funded by EPSRC to develop better understanding of and new methods in AI. This will be achieved by research at the interface of AI and Mathematics. The Prob_AI hub will focus on probabilistic AI, and bring researchers with skills across areas such as Bayesian and Computational Statistics, Dynamical Systems, Numerical Analysis, PDES, Probability, Stochastic Analysis and Uncertainty Quantification to work with AI and Machine Learning researchers.

**STOR-i** was established in 2010 as an EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training. Its academic prowess and high levels of success have led to a further investment from 2019 with an increased capacity of potential students to 70 in total across the full cohort. This is a multi-million pound award from EPSRC, substantial support from Lancaster University and an additional £5.2m from Industrial Partners. All partners see a national need for the cohort-based approach offered by STOR-i and together will expand on its existing success.
